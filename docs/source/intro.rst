Brief Overview
--------------

Bismillaah,

We introduce a brief description of the Ferret and Panoply installation guide document. 

This document has been prepared as a guide for installing Ferret (https://ferret.pmel.noaa.gov/Ferret/) and Panoply (https://www.giss.nasa.gov/tools/panoply/) on the Windows 10 operating system.

- Ferret and Panoply are command-line-based applications that can be useful to display images or graphics of scientific data processing results in NetCDF format.
- The Ferret and Panoply are widely used by scientists and researchers in several earth science fields, such as climate science, oceanography and the atmosphere.
- In addition to visualizing scientific data, Ferret can analyze data, including mathematical operations, interpolation, and statistical analysis.
- On the other hand, Panoply focuses on data visualization, allowing users to create maps easily, plots and animations from scientific data. 

Both software is installed on operating systems such as Windows, macOS, and Linux.
However, this document only describes the installation guide for the Windows 10 operating system. This document explains the installation of Ferret and Panoply applications on the Windows 10 operating system.

The stages in installing Panoply are as follows:

1. Download the Panoply software,
2. Extract and execute the downloaded software file.

The Ferret installation stages are challenging since the Ferret is installed on the Linux operating system, which runs on the Windows operating system.
In brief, the Ferret installation steps on the Windows 10 operating system are as follows:

1. install Linux on Windows 10,
2. install Ferret on the Linux platform at the previous stage.
